## ðŸ§  About Me
I'm Kevin Onyoh, a backend developer passionate about building reliable, scalable, and well-structured systems. I enjoy working behind the scenes to power real-world applicationsâ€”writing clean APIs, designing databases, and optimizing server-side logic. With experience using Node.js, NestJS, PostgreSQL, and cloud tools.
I love learning, solving tough problems, and working in teams that care about quality and impact. Whether it's refining data models, improving API performance, or collaborating across disciplines, I bring a thoughtful and growth-driven mindset to every project. I'm always looking for opportunities where I can grow, build useful products, and contribute to something meaningful.
